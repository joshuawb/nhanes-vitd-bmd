## Vitamin D Deficiency and Spine Bone Mineral Density in
## NHANES 2017–2018

### Abstract
The association between vitamin-D deficiency and lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD)
among U.S. adults aged 50+ using NHANES 2017-2018 has been quantified in this report. Design-based analyses accounted for the complex multistage sampling (weights, strata,
PSUs) and, due to BMD missingness, used complete-case subsetting with raking to restore
sex, age-band, and ethnicity margins to the full sample. The estimated total number of
Vitamin D deficient 50+ year-olds in the U.S population is 3, 152, 552 (95% CI: 2, 219, 143 -
4, 085, 962). The estimated average lumbar spine bone mineral density for 50+ year-olds in
the U.S. is 1.0053 g/cm2
(95% CI: 0.9897 - 1.0210 g/cm2
). The primary adjusted Gamma
log-link model estimated a small, non-significant (p = 0.1519) association between deficiency and BMD when accounting for sex, age, and ethnicity. Covariates showed expected
patterns, including lower BMD among females and differences across ethnic groups, with
evidence that the sex gap varies with age. The findings suggest that DXA screening for low
BMD for fracture-risk reduction or other reasons should be prioritised towards higher-risk
groups such as older females as opposed to vitamin-D deficient individuals.
